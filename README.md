**Optimal ablation**

Optimal ablation (OA) is a new ablation method for interpretability. OA sets a componentâ€™s value to the constant value that minimizes the expected loss incurred by the ablated model.

In this repository, we demo OA on three applications of ablation.
1. Circuit discovery ([Conmy et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14997))
2. Causal tracing ([Meng et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05262)
3. Prediction with latent representations ([Belrose et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08112))
